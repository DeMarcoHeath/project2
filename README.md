# Project 2: PedalPals

PedalPals is an app that allows people in the community to list their bikes for free for people to use. 

## User Story

As a community minded person with a bike, I want to help others by allowing them to use it.
As a person who needs a bike but doesn’t have one, I want 
to borrow a bike and return it when I’m done.
